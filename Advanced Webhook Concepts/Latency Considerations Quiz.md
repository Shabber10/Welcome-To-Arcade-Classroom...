### Question 3:  
#### Why do we need to have different considerations around latency from voice channels to chat channels?  
- ❌ Because customers when using chat channels are more keen to drop the session in case of delays vs in the voice channel.  
- ❌ Chat channels are more prone to delays.  
- ✅ **In voice channels, it is not possible to use UI elements to illustrate a delay in the answer, making it seem like the call might have a problem.**  
- ❌ Not needed to have different considerations since the webhook behavior is the same.
