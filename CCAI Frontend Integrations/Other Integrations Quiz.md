# 🌟 Multi-Channel AI-Driven Solutions Assessment

---

## Question 1  
**Your employer asks you to design an AI-driven multi-channel automated voice and text solution across telephone, website, and social media. Which approach should you take?**  
- ✅ **Integrate voice, web, and social channels in one solution architecture with a common Dialogflow virtual agent.**  
- ❌ Build a separate Dialogflow virtual agent for each channel (voice, web, social) and connect them together using backend logic to transfer conversations seamlessly.  
- ❌ Utilize separate telephony, chat, and social channel solutions, but use the same Dialogflow for each so you can merge data at the backend.  
- ❌ Create separate telephony, text, and social channel solutions, and keep the data separate too. You cannot mix channels in your virtual agent.

## Question 2

- ✅ **Your developer team may fork the integration to suit your needs.**  
- ❌ You can get all the benefits of CCAI, plus you can customize how the integration works.  
- ❌ The community maintains the code so my integration will stay up to date.  
- ✅ **Allows you to extend your reach to platforms that do not have built-in integrations.**
