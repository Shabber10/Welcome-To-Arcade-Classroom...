## Question 1  
**Which of the following pre-closing sequences signals the end of the conversation more strongly?**  
- ✅ **A- Thank you so much for calling us today and have a great day. C- Thanks! You too.**  
- ❌ A- Is there anything else I can help you with today? C- No, that was all.  
- ❌ C- Thank you so much. A- No problem.  
- ❌ C- I just saw this error with my bill so I called. A- No absolutely. Glad we sorted it out.

## Question 2  
**What’s a human-like closing technique not commonly found in traditional virtual agents?**  
- ❌ Ask the user if there is anything else they need help with in case they have other issues.  
- ❌ End the call thanking the user as soon as they say there’s nothing else they want to do.  
- ❌ Ensure the call gets disconnected after the agent says “bye” in case the user never replies.  
- ✅ **Allow the user to react to each pre-closing to ensure they’re ready to end the conversation.**
